# **Landroid Simulator**

This is a webservice used to simulate a Landroid Cloud device.<br/>
Currently this only supports Worx Landroid, but in time this will also support Ferrex, Kress and Landxcape devices.

This is mainly created to aid in developing [pyWorxcloud](https://pypi.org/project/pyworxcloud/) and in turn also the [Landroid_Cloud](https://github.com/MTrab/landroid_cloud) integration for [Home-Assistant](https://home-assistant.io) - but I guess it can be used in other scenarios as well.

*!! Currently there are **NO** documentation available, as this is in a pure development stage at the moment !!*
